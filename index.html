          <p id="p1">
            Fantasy basketball is a popular online game where a group of players draft real professional NBA players onto their
            team. Throughout the season, you are placed in head to head matchups against your fellow league members, in which the
            winner is determined by the stats produced by the NBA players that you play on your team. A players record is determined
            by the performance of their team throughout the season. The winner of a fantasy basketball team is the last team
            standing after a long season and postseason.
          </p>
          <p id="p2">
            Fantasy Basketball StatTrak is a single stop webpage for all your fantasy basketball statistical data needs. 
            Since your team's statistics are a crucial factor in winning in fantasy basketball, I created this website to allow
            users to compare player statistics with the visual aid of a graph. 
            The website is a gold mine for people looking to gain a competitive edge before their fantasy drafts and also for throughout the
            season. A user has access to past data on NBA players statistics and the top 50 averages of each statistical category which allows
            them to make educated and strategic decisions on who they would want to draft for their team.
          </p>
          <p id="p3">
            Some features of this website include using the search bar to find current NBA players and being 
            able to compare their average statistics against the top 50 of each statistical category. You 
            can continue adding as many players as you wish to compare these players against eachother and 
            against the top 50. Upon finishing a search, a player card is displayed below the graph. This player
            card displays general information regarding the player such as their age, current team, and their
            played position.
          </p>
          <p id="p4">
            The player card also contains their last three years of statistical averages for
            you to see their improvement or decline over time. If you no longer wish to compare 
            a players data, you can remove the player by clicking the trashbin icon in the player card.
            You can also just click the players name in the graph legend if you still wish to add the player 
            back again later. Each player card also has a button labeled "Recent News" which if available, will
            open a news article regarding relevant recent news about the player.
